# site-mapper
This is a small sample t show how to incorporate angular 4, leaflet, esri-leaflet, etc.

I used npm to install leaflet, esri-leaflet, leaflet-easayprint, leaflet-draw, bootstrap, and omnivore.
This example has a basic home page and a site list page.  When you click on a site the app opens a map 
showing where the site is located.
